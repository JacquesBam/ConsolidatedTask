## Usage
The website has a functional website login and registration system accessible from the navbar, although the only benefit to creating an account is being able to purchase a book and you can browse any and all authors and books without logging in. 
The splash page will have a list of available books containing links to pages that will have more information about the authors or the books themselves.
